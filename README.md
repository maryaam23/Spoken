Ethnic Group Recognition from Speech – ENCS5344 Project
This project presents a speech-based recognition system developed to classify speakers into two ethnic groups—Asian and White British—based on phonetic features in their English speech. Using the Voices Across Birmingham dataset, we implemented three machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

🎯 Objectives
Develop a system that detects ethnicity based on speech.

Extract audio features such as MFCCs, Pitch, Energy, and Zero-Crossing Rate.

Evaluate and compare multiple machine learning models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

🧠 Techniques Used
Audio Preprocessing: silence removal using librosa

Feature Extraction: MFCCs, ∆MFCC, ∆∆MFCC, energy, pitch, zero-crossing

Models: KNN, GMM, SVM

Evaluation: classification metrics and scenario-based testing
